can you read this paper and give me the abstract of this paper.

ChatGPT: 

The abstract of the paper titled "Machine Learning that Matters" is as follows:

Much of current machine learning (ML) research has lost its connection to problems of importance to the larger world of science and society. From this perspective, there are glaring limitations in the data sets we investigate, the metrics we employ for evaluation, and the degree to which results are communicated back to their originating domains. What changes are needed to how we conduct research to increase the impact that ML has? We present six Impact Challenges to explicitly focus the fieldâ€™s energy and attention, and we discuss existing obstacles that must be addressed. We aim to inspire ongoing discussion and focus on ML that matters.

You: 

great, you are a big company that has alot of computing power and alot of code behind you. 

Now i have a challenge to be able to read/extract data from 1000s of such pdfs, i am new coding like yesterday i did my "hello world" code. Give me the top 10 of the best ways possible to extract text/ tables and images from such pdfs and the best way to store them like best file (eg - word, md or best option you have to store the extracted data in sections). 

Challenge - 

- I have tried the obsious basics like pymupdf of pytessearcts but the requriement is to get the data as per section like the above questions and these guys while extacting data they guys extract it and they do not have sense of segregating the content based on topics/heading and tables. 

- As you can see the pdf is divided into sections like it has test on both sides, this also makes it hard for normal pdf readers hard to extract in sections or with context. 

for now only provide the best 10 options i would use to extract text and best way to store the data for futher use.
